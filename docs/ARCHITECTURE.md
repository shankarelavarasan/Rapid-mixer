# Rapid AI Assistant Architecture

## Overview

The Rapid AI Assistant is a web application that processes various file types using AI to generate intelligent responses. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between different components.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend

The frontend is a web-based interface that allows users to:

- Upload files of various formats (PDF, Excel, Word, Text, Images)
- Select templates for specific processing tasks
- Enter prompts for the AI to process
- View and export the AI-generated responses

Key frontend files:

- `docs/index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `docs/script.js`: Core JavaScript functionality
- `docs/modules/fileManager.js`: Handles file selection and processing
- `docs/modules/templateManager.js`: Manages template selection
- `docs/modules/gemini.js`: Communicates with the backend Gemini API

### 2. Backend

The backend is a Node.js Express server that handles:

- API endpoints for client requests
- File processing and text extraction
- Template management
- Communication with the Google Gemini API

#### API Layer

- `routes/gemini.js`: Defines the API endpoints for Gemini interactions
- `middleware/errorHandler.js`: Centralized error handling middleware

#### Service Layer

- `services/fileProcessingService.js`: Handles extraction of text from various file types
- `services/templateService.js`: Manages template operations
- `services/geminiService.js`: Handles communication with the Gemini API

#### Utility Layer

- `utils/errorUtils.js`: Error handling utilities
- `utils/fileUtils.js`: File operation utilities
- `utils/cacheManager.js`: Caching functionality

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User uploads files and enters a prompt
   - Frontend validates input and sends to backend

2. **Request Processing**:
   - Backend receives request at `/api/ask-gemini` endpoint
   - Request parameters are validated
   - Files are processed to extract text content

3. **AI Processing**:
   - Extracted text and prompt are sent to Gemini API
   - Responses are generated for each file

4. **Response Handling**:
   - Backend formats and returns responses
   - Frontend displays results to the user
   - User can export results in various formats

## Error Handling

The application implements a robust error handling strategy:

1. **Custom Error Types**:
   - `FileProcessingError`: For file-related errors
   - `TemplateError`: For template-related errors

2. **Higher-Order Function**:
   - `withErrorHandling`: Wraps async functions with consistent error handling

3. **Parameter Validation**:
   - `validateParams`: Ensures required parameters are present

4. **Middleware**:
   - Express middleware for handling API-level errors

## Caching Strategy

The application uses caching to improve performance:

1. **Template Caching**:
   - Templates are cached using `node-cache`
   - Cache keys are generated based on template ID

2. **File Caching**:
   - Processed file content can be cached
   - Cache keys are generated based on file metadata

## Testing Strategy

The application includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Tests for individual functions and components
   - Mock dependencies for isolated testing

2. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Tests for various error scenarios
   - Ensures errors are properly caught and handled

## Deployment

The application is deployed on a cloud platform with the following considerations:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - API keys and configuration stored as environment variables

2. **Error Logging**:
   - Errors are logged for monitoring and debugging

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Key metrics are tracked for performance optimization

## Future Architecture Enhancements

1. **Microservices**:
   - Split into smaller, specialized services
   - File processing service
   - Template service
   - AI service

2. **Queue System**:
   - Implement message queue for processing large batches
   - Asynchronous processing for better scalability

3. **Advanced Caching**:
   - Distributed cache for better performance
   - Cache invalidation strategies

4. **TypeScript Migration**:
   - Add static typing for better code quality
   - Improved developer experience

5. **Containerization**:
   - Docker containers for consistent deployment
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
